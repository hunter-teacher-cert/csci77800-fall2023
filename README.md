## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
At the beginning of each session, a designated duo will present on a topic of interest to them (and hopefully all of us!).

### Topics:
A list of potential topics is available in <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/3ae3c6e0d00179ff31f8b2528d336c6edcc7d27f/ethicacy_topics.csv>

### Deliverables:
- PDF in each partner's **ethicacy** folder in your work repo, subject to these guidelines:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) included
  - summary of issue or newsworthy development
  - single page
- Other supporting files may be added to ethicacy folder. Each partners' folder must contain all files.

### Presentation
* _GOAL: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~3-5min per side.
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns
* Weekly Ethicacy will take place at the beginning of each week's live session.

### Asynchronous Component
* Within a week of the live session during which a Weekly Ethicacy is delivered, each participant will post to the corresponding thread in the `ethics-we` channel a response:
  - clearly indicating chosen side
  - supporting their choice with supporting documentation, by referencing personal experience, and/or by expanding upon comments from live presentation or preceding channel discussion.
* _Participants are expected to establish communications with their partner as soon as possible, and collaborate to maximize presentation quality._

## Weekly Progression

### Week 1
#### Sync
* What comprises Ethical CS?
* Course overview
  - syllabus
  - grading
  - Github Assignment Repo setup
  - Weekly Ethicacy
  - How async will work (vs assignments and homework)
* **Ground rules for discussions:** _We will grow/learn the most if we..._
  - respect one another's positions.
  - separate person (and their worth) from their opinions/stance.
  - listen for understanding.
  - step into others' shoes.
  - sometimes play "Devil's advocate" to suss out unfamilar/distasteful/problematic positions.

#### Async
* Due 9/14 9:00pm 
* Review pre-reading (ThinkPython Ch.1-4) and additional chapters as necessary, utilize `#python-fu` channel as necessary to discuss.
* Bookmark Ch.9-10 for reference now and later in the term.
* Consult your summer java codebase as necessary, and re-write in python 
  - Game of Nim
  - Game of Life
  - Binary Search : iterative or recursive version
* DELIVERABLE:
