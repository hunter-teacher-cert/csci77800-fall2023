## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
Each synchronous sessions starts with the "weekly ethicacy."  These presentations are on a topic related to ethics and tech chosen by the presenting duo.  On their day, the team will make a short 10 minute presentation.

### Topics:
A list of potential topics is available in <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/3ae3c6e0d00179ff31f8b2528d336c6edcc7d27f/ethicacy_topics.csv>

### Deliverables:
- PDF in each partner's **ethicacy** folder in your work repo, subject to these guidelines:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) included
  - summary of issue or newsworthy development
  - single page
- Other supporting files may be added to ethicacy folder. Each partners' folder must contain all files.

### Presentation
* _GOAL: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~5 minutes per side.
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns (this time is beyond the 10 minutes).
* Weekly Ethicacy will take place at the beginning of each week's live session.

### Asynchronous Component
* Within a week of the live session during which a Weekly Ethicacy is delivered, each participant will post to the corresponding thread in the `ethics-we` channel a response:
  - clearly indicating chosen side
  - supporting their choice with supporting documentation, by referencing personal experience, and/or by expanding upon comments from live presentation or preceding channel discussion.
* _Participants are expected to establish communications with their partner as soon as possible, and collaborate to maximize presentation quality._

* * * 

## Weekly Progression

### Week 1
#### Sync
* *Discussion:* What comprises Ethical CS?
  - Pairwise breakout (10 minutes): Sum up Ethical Computer Science in a few sentences.  Examine some of the web references in <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/b9808f3e344f53f37dd70166f061dc679b016352/resources/links.md>
  - Pairwise breakout (10 minutes): What are some of the major contemporary topics in EthiCS?
* *Structural review:* How is this course set up?
  - Syllabus, Zoom, schedule, all available in School of Education Google Document share.
  - Review syllabus.
  - Review Ethicacy presentation idea; review schedule of Ethicacy presentations.  
  - How async will work (vs assignments and homework)
  - Github Assignment Repo setup
  
* **Ground rules for discussions:** _We will grow/learn the most if we..._
  - respect one another's positions.
  - separate person (and their worth) from their opinions/stance.
  - listen for understanding.
  - step into others' shoes.
  - sometimes play "Devil's advocate" to suss out unfamilar/distasteful/problematic positions.

* Begin studying basic Python.



#### Async + Homework
* Due 9/7 9:00am.  Late work will not be accepted.

*** Part 1 - to be developed in a folder in your repo: week_01
Find an article dealing with a CS issue and:
- Post a link to the async channel (use `#ethics-async`) with a link to the article and a short (1 or 2 sentences) summary/title. 
- Write and post a short (no more than 1 page) summary (which should include a hyperlink to the article) to the week_00 folder of your repo named
  article.pdf. You can also store additional files.
- Your analysis should ideally be with respect to at least one of these groups:
  - Your students
  - Your community/family
  - You
  - The world at large.

*** Part 2 - to be posted to the `#ethics-async` channel of Slack.
Respond to at least 2 other classmates posts by adding to a thread under their part 1 post.

Offer any/all of:
- your take on the topic.
- extra information.
- links for further reading.
- your personal experience with something similar.
- something this inspired you to think about.
- anything additional that you feel is productive and relevant.
No need to read their PDF, you can just read the source material.

*** Part 3 - Python
* It is important to focus on building your Python skills.  Utilize the `#python-fu` channel as necessary to discuss and seek support from your instructor and peers.
* You can find the Python resources here: <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/b9808f3e344f53f37dd70166f061dc679b016352/resources/readme.md>
* Read ThinkPython Chapters 1-4.  Additional chapters may be read as you see fit for completing the work.
* Chapters 9 and 10 will serve as references now and later this semester.
* Review your Java codebase, specifically the below assignments, which you will eventually re-write in Python:
  - Game of Nim **this is the only program rewrite due for this week**
  - Game of Life. **subsequent weeks**
  - Binary Search : iterative or recursive version. **subsequent weeks**

* DELIVERABLE:
```
your-ethics-work-repo/py/nim.py
```
Only nim.py is due for this week.

  - for each sourcecode file you submit, include a heading comment block in this format:
  ```python
