## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
Each synchronous sessions starts with the "weekly ethicacy."  These presentations are on a topic related to ethics and tech chosen by the presenting duo.  On their day, the team will make a short 10 minute presentation.

### Topics:
A list of potential topics is available in <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/3ae3c6e0d00179ff31f8b2528d336c6edcc7d27f/ethicacy_topics.csv>

### Deliverables:
- PDF in each partner's **ethicacy** folder in your work repo, subject to these guidelines:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) included
  - summary of issue or newsworthy development
  - single page
- Other supporting files may be added to ethicacy folder. Each partners' folder must contain all files.

### Presentation
* _GOAL: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~5 minutes per side.
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns (this time is beyond the 10 minutes).
* Weekly Ethicacy will take place at the beginning of each week's live session.

### Asynchronous Component
* Within a week of the live session during which a Weekly Ethicacy is delivered, each participant will post to the corresponding thread in the `ethics-we` channel a response:
  - clearly indicating chosen side
  - supporting their choice with supporting documentation, by referencing personal experience, and/or by expanding upon comments from live presentation or preceding channel discussion.
* _Participants are expected to establish communications with their partner as soon as possible, and collaborate to maximize presentation quality._

## Weekly Progression

### Week 1
#### Sync
* What comprises Ethical CS?
  - Pairwise breakout (10 minutes): Sum up Ethical Computer Science in a few sentences.  Examine some of the web references in <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/b9808f3e344f53f37dd70166f061dc679b016352/resources/links.md>
  - Pairwise breakout (10 minutes): What are some of the major contemporary topics in EthiCS?
* Course overview
  - syllabus
  - grading
  - Github Assignment Repo setup
  - Weekly Ethicacy
  - How async will work (vs assignments and homework)
* **Ground rules for discussions:** _We will grow/learn the most if we..._
  - respect one another's positions.
  - separate person (and their worth) from their opinions/stance.
  - listen for understanding.
  - step into others' shoes.
  - sometimes play "Devil's advocate" to suss out unfamilar/distasteful/problematic positions.

#### Async + Homework
* Due 9/7 9:00am.  Late work will not be accepted.
* Because week #1 has no Ethicacy presentation, this week's async component and homework will focus on building your Python skills.  Utilize the `#python-fu` channel as necessary to discuss and seek support from your instructor and peers.
* You can find the Python resources here: <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2023/blob/b9808f3e344f53f37dd70166f061dc679b016352/resources/readme.md>
* Read ThinkPython Chapters 1-4.  Additional chapters may be read as you see fit for completing the work.
* Chapters 9 and 10 will serve as references now and later this semester.
* Review your Java codebase, specifically the below assignments, which you will re-write in Python:
  - Game of Nim
  - Game of Life
  - Binary Search : iterative or recursive version

* DELIVERABLE:
